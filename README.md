# computer_graphics-lahumbert
Final project for my Computer graphics class - Fall 2023

## Project description

The goal of this project was to create a 3D visualization of buildings.

For each rendering, each building would have a random size and shape.
they would have a few windows on their sides, represented by a cube of another color that protrudes a little from the buildings.

Moreover, a day/night cycle that would last a few seconds would be present, that could modify the color and
luminosity of the buildings accordingly.

Finally, there would be a light coming from the windows of the buildings during the night phase.

## How to run
To run the project, you need glfw and glew installed on your computer.

Then, you can run the following commands:
```bash
   make run
```
